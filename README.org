#+TITLE: Poster template

[WIP] A LaTeX beamer poster style inspired from [[https://github.com/gbaydin/oxford-poster][oxford posters. ]]

** Installation

Install [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][pdflatex]]
#+begin_src
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
#+end_src

** Running

#+begin_src
pdflatex hhu_poster.tex
#+end_src

** HOW TO USE
- #+begin_srchhu_poster.tex#+end_src is where you edit your text. 
- There are three columns on default. Each column is 1/3 of the text width.
- If you only want to have 2 columns, use `\begin{column}{.47\textwidth}` to keep it nicely spaced.
- Create a topic block with the environment `\begin{block} \end{block}`.

** ADJUSTING TITLE, AUTHORS AND LOGO
- If you have many authors and the text starts overlapping with the logos, the relevant section you want to change is in the .sty file from line 62 onwards. The top banner is constructed from two columns, each `.47/paperwidth` long.
---------------------
| title    |        |
| authors  | Logos  |
---------------------
- tweak the size values of the logos and the column width until everything fits
